# Screenshot Clean Up

I take a lot of screenshots on my laptop that I think I am going to use later or reference sometime in the future. They often sit their for months on end because I forget about them. When I have a screenshot that is important I usually rename it and move it to a specific folder, however if I never get around to it, the file will probably stay in its default location on the Desktop. I scheduled this simple script to run daily on my computer and to send me notifications for screenshots I have not touched in a week so that I can move them or rename them accordingly, reminding me to organize them properly. Otherwise they will be deleted if they are left untouched for more than a month. 

This was mostly to practice automation with Python3 and I am not sure how good this code is, surely has some issues. However, if you would like to use it, you can fork it and pass your Mac username as an argument. 

I hope to be able to add some kind of automation to rename and move the screenshots into particular folders. Although I am unsure of how to approach this now since the folders I would want to move them to and names I would give them would be pretty personalized.
