# Screenshot Clean Up

I take a lot of screenshots on my laptop that I think I am going to use later or reference sometime in the future. They often sit their for months on end because I forget about them. But, sometimes they are important and I forget to move them to specified folders. I scheduled this simple script to run daily on my computer to send me notifications for screenshots I have not touched in a week so that I can move them or rename them accordingly, forcing me to organize them properly. Otherwise they will be deleted if they are left untouched for more than a month.
